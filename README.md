# Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration

## Objective
This project is designed for a fresher aspiring to join as a **ReactJS Developer**. It evaluates the candidate's understanding of foundational web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and essential React concepts. The goal is to develop an advanced **To-Do application** with features like API integration, Redux-based state management, responsiveness, and user authentication.

## Project Requirements

### 1. **Frontend Development and API Integration**
- **HTML**: Structure the layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Style the application (you can use frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Material-UI**).
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implement application logic.
- **API Integration**: Use a public API (e.g., a weather API) to display relevant data.
  - Example: If a task is related to outdoor activities, show current weather conditions.
  - Implement error handling for API requests and display errors gracefully in the UI.

---

### 2. **React Components and State Management**
- **React Functional Components**:
  - **TaskInput**: Component for adding a new task.
  - **TaskList**: Component for displaying the list of tasks.
- **React Hooks**: Demonstrate usage of `useState`, `useEffect`, and other hooks.
- **Redux**: Use **Redux Thunk** or **Redux Saga** for managing asynchronous actions (e.g., API calls).
- **Advanced State Management**: Implement global state management for tasks and user authentication.

---

### 3. **Responsive Design**
- Ensure the application is fully responsive for **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** devices.
- Use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout and responsiveness.
- Follow a **mobile-first design approach** for development.

---

### 4. **Core Functionality**
1. **Add Task**: 
   - Input a task via a text field and add it by pressing a button or hitting Enter.
2. **View Tasks**:
   - Display all tasks in a list format.
3. **Delete Task**:
   - Allow users to delete a task with a click of a delete button.
4. **Task Prioritization**:
   - Enable users to assign priorities (High, Medium, Low) and display tasks accordingly.
5. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Use **local storage** or **session storage** to save tasks and authentication status.

---

### 5. **User Authentication**
- Implement a simple **login/logout** feature using Redux for state management.
- Simulate authentication (mock the backend).
- Protect the To-Do list so that tasks are visible only to logged-in users.

---

## Additional Instructions
1. **Project Structure**: Follow best practices for organizing the project.
   - Maintain a scalable and clean project structure as the application grows in complexity.
2. **Code Quality**: Prioritize clean and maintainable code.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names.
   - Add comments where necessary.
3. **Scalability**: Ensure the application is modular and scalable for future enhancements.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does the application meet the requirements?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, clean, and maintainable?
- **API Integration**: Is the API integration functional and error-handling implemented effectively?
- **State Management**: Is Redux used effectively for global state and async actions?
- **Responsive Design**: Is the application responsive across different device sizes?
- **Authentication**: Is user authentication implemented correctly and seamlessly?
